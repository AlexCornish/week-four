Excel & R:
- I'd say that the fact that the data has 3 large peaks around 1789, 1819, and the late 1830s is more of an artefact of the collection method then the data itself as I find it hard to believe that between the years 1794 and 1802 and 1802 and 1810, that there were no newspaper articles on the subject of colonies from any resources accessed. Furthermore, I find some of the outliers in the data set especially strange.
